# REST Countries API with Color Theme Switcher

This project is a challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io), where a website was developed that consumes the [REST Countries API](https://restcountries.com) to display information about countries.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- **React** (Created with Vite)
- **TypeScript**
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **Zustand** for global state management
- **Vercel** for deployment

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Display all countries from the API on the homepage.
- Search for a country using an input field.
- Filter countries by region.
- Click on a country to see detailed information.
- Navigate between neighboring countries on the details page.
- Toggle between light and dark modes.

## ðŸ’¡ Learnings

This project was my first time using **Zustand** for global state management, which made it much easier to communicate between components without the need for prop drilling.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Run the Project Locally

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/silvamaarcus/country-game.git

   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

The project will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`.
